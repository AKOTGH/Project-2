        <p>
            Kimberly Bryant is my tech hero. She is a technology leader 
            and social entrepreneur best known as the founder of Black 
            Girls Code, a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing 
            opportunities for Black girls and women in computer science 
            and related STEM fields.
        </p>

        <!-- Background and motivation -->
        <p>
            Bryant founded Black Girls Code after noticing a severe lack of
            racial and gender diversity in technical spaces, including those
            her own daughter was entering. Rather than accepting these barriers
            as inevitable, she focused on early intervention—providing young
            students with coding education, mentorship, and a supportive
            community long before college or the workforce.
        </p>

        <!-- Connection to implicit bias -->
        <p>
            Her work directly confronts implicit bias in education and technology.
            Many technology pipelines unintentionally favor students who already
            have access to resources, encouragement, and representation.
            Black Girls Code challenges these assumptions by demonstrating that
            talent is universal, while opportunity is not.
        </p>

        <!-- Intersectionality emphasis -->
        <p>
            Bryant’s leadership is also deeply intersectional. Her programs
            recognize that race and gender intersect in ways that create unique
            barriers for Black girls, particularly in environments where they
            are often underrepresented or stereotyped. By centering these
            experiences, her work goes beyond surface-level diversity efforts
            and instead builds long-term structural change.
        </p>

        <!-- Reflection tying hero to course themes -->
        <p>
            Kimberly Bryant exemplifies how technology leadership can be used to
            advance equity, disrupt bias, and create inclusive futures—making
            her an ideal example of a tech hero who challenges norms rather than
            reinforcing them.

        <img src="images/yeshimabeit-milner.jpg" 
             alt="Yeshimabeit Milner, founder of Data for Black Lives" 
             class="responsive-img">

        <p>
            Yeshimabeit Milner is my tech hero. She is a data technologist, activist, 
            and the founder and executive director of Data for Black Lives (D4BL). Her 
            organization is a movement of activists, organizers, and mathematicians 
            committed to using data science to create concrete and measurable change in 
            the lives of marginalized communities.
        </p>

        <p>
            Milner challenges the standard tech industry norm that treats data merely as 
            a commodity to be extracted. She recognizes that historical biases are often 
            hardcoded into the algorithms used for credit scoring, predictive policing, 
            and algorithmic pricing. These systems frequently operate as "black boxes" 
            that bypass consumer protection and disproportionately harm people of color. 
            Rather than rejecting data science, Milner’s work focuses on reclaiming it, 
            advocating for data to be used as a tool for social change and equity rather 
            than a weapon of systemic oppression.
        </p>

        <p>
            Under her leadership, D4BL has pushed for critical accountability in tech, 
            demanding transparency in how algorithms make high-stakes decisions about 
            people's lives. She emphasizes that algorithms are not neutral math; they 
            are built by people with inherent biases. By bridging the gap between tech 
            experts and community organizers, she is fighting to ensure that consumer 
            welfare and civil rights are at the forefront of technological development.
        </p>

        <p>
            I chose Milner because she exemplifies what it means to be a leader in 
            advancing equity in technology today. She is not a Silicon Valley CEO 
            building apps for convenience; she is a trailblazer demanding that our 
            data infrastructure respects and protects the public.

        <!-- Hero Description -->
        <p>
            Bridgit Mendler is my tech hero because she completely redefined 
            what a career in technology can look like. She seamlessly 
            transitioned from entertainment into building and leading in the tech world, 
            cofounding a satellite data startup while also pursuing advanced degrees at 
            MIT and Harvard. Her path proves that creativity, curiosity, and ambition 
            belong in tech just as much as coding, and she inspires me to believe that 
            you do not have to fit one mold to make a real impact in the industry.
        </p>
