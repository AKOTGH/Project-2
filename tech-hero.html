        <p>
            Kimberly Bryant is a technology leader and social entrepreneur best
            known as the founder of Black Girls Code, a nonprofit organization
            dedicated to increasing opportunities for Black girls and women in
            computer science and related STEM fields.
        </p>

        <!-- Background and motivation -->
        <p>
            Bryant founded Black Girls Code after noticing a severe lack of
            racial and gender diversity in technical spaces, including those
            her own daughter was entering. Rather than accepting these barriers
            as inevitable, she focused on early intervention—providing young
            students with coding education, mentorship, and a supportive
            community long before college or the workforce.
        </p>

        <!-- Connection to implicit bias -->
        <p>
            Her work directly confronts implicit bias in education and technology.
            Many technology pipelines unintentionally favor students who already
            have access to resources, encouragement, and representation.
            Black Girls Code challenges these assumptions by demonstrating that
            talent is universal, while opportunity is not.
        </p>

        <!-- Intersectionality emphasis -->
        <p>
            Bryant’s leadership is also deeply intersectional. Her programs
            recognize that race and gender intersect in ways that create unique
            barriers for Black girls, particularly in environments where they
            are often underrepresented or stereotyped. By centering these
            experiences, her work goes beyond surface-level diversity efforts
            and instead builds long-term structural change.
        </p>

        <!-- Impact and reach -->
        <p>
            Since its founding, Black Girls Code has reached tens of thousands
            of students across the United States and internationally, offering
            workshops in programming, robotics, game design, and digital media.
            Bryant’s approach emphasizes confidence-building alongside technical
            skills, helping participants envision themselves as creators—not
            just consumers—of technology.

        <!-- Reflection tying hero to course themes -->

            Kimberly Bryant exemplifies how technology leadership can be used to
            advance equity, disrupt bias, and create inclusive futures—making
            her an ideal example of a tech hero who challenges norms rather than
            reinforcing them.
