        <h2>What Is Implicit Bias?</h2>

        <!-- Beginner-friendly explanation -->
        <p>
            Implicit bias refers to unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that
            influence how we perceive, evaluate, and interact with others.
            These biases develop through socialization, media exposure,
            and cultural norms, often without our awareness.
        </p>

        <!-- Why it matters -->
        <p>
            In educational, professional, and technological contexts,
            implicit bias can affect hiring decisions, user experience design,
            algorithmic outcomes, and access to opportunities.

        <h2>Intersectionality</h2>

        <!-- Clear definition -->
        <p>
            Intersectionality explains how multiple aspects of identity—such as
            race, gender, class, sexuality, and ability—interact to shape lived
            experiences and access to power.
        </p>

        <!-- Applied context -->
        <p>
            Understanding intersectionality helps us recognize why a single-axis
            approach to equity often fails to address the complexity of real lives,
            especially in technology and policy design.
