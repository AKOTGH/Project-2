        <h2>What Is Implicit Bias?</h2>

        <!-- Clear definition -->
        <p>
            Implicit bias refers to unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that
            influence how people perceive, evaluate, and interact with others.
            These biases operate automatically and often contradict our
            consciously held values or beliefs.
        </p>

        <!-- How bias forms -->
        <p>
            Implicit biases develop through repeated exposure to cultural
            messages, media representations, social norms, and institutional
            practices. Over time, the brain learns shortcuts to process
            information quickly—sometimes at the cost of fairness or accuracy.
        </p>

        <!-- Why it matters -->
        <p>
            In academic, professional, and technological contexts, implicit bias
            can affect grading, hiring decisions, user experience design,
            algorithmic outcomes, and access to resources. Because these biases
            are unconscious, they can be especially difficult to identify
            without intentional reflection.

    <!-- Intersectionality Section -->
    <section>
        
        <h2>What Is Intersectionality?</h2>

        <!-- Definition -->
        <p>
            Intersectionality is a framework for understanding how multiple
            aspects of identity—such as race, gender, class, sexuality, and
            ability—interact to shape lived experiences and access to power.
        </p>

        <!-- Applied explanation -->
        <p>
            Rather than viewing identity categories in isolation,
            intersectionality emphasizes that systems of inequality overlap.
            For example, the experiences of a Black woman in technology cannot
            be fully understood by examining race or gender alone.
        </p>

        <!-- Connection to bias -->
        <p>
            Intersectionality is essential for understanding implicit bias
            because biases often operate differently depending on context.
            A one-size-fits-all approach to diversity can unintentionally ignore
            the people most affected by overlapping forms of discrimination.
        </p>

    <!-- Why This Matters in Tech -->
    <section>
        <h2>Why These Concepts Matter in Technology</h2>

        <!-- Tech-focused framing -->
        <p>
            Technology is often viewed as neutral or objective, but it is shaped
            by human decisions. Implicit bias can influence which problems are
            prioritized, whose voices are included, and how systems are designed.
        </p>

        <!-- Real-world implications -->
        <p>
            When designers and developers fail to consider intersectionality,
            technologies can unintentionally reinforce inequality—such as biased
            algorithms, inaccessible interfaces, or exclusionary data sets.
            Awareness is a critical first step toward more ethical and inclusive
            technological systems.
